## About this package

This repository was the submodule for the base package of the [Unvanquished](https://unvanquished.net) game.

On `2023-04-11` this base package [has been reintegrated](https://github.com/Unvanquished/Unvanquished/pull/2625) in `Unvanquished` repository and is no longer a submodule but [a subfolder](https://github.com/Unvanquished/Unvanquished/tree/master/pkg/unvanquished_src.dpkdir).

This submodule was used in those Unvanquished releases:

- `0.51.0`
- `0.51.1`
- `0.52.0`
- `0.52.1`
- `0.53.0`
- `0.53.1`
- `0.53.2`
- `0.54.0`

This submodule is needed to rebuild one of those old releases or to bisect something introduced in one of those old releases.
